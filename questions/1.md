# Task 1: How Does the Internet Work?

### What is an IP address and what is its primary function?

**Importance:** Understanding IP addresses is fundamental to knowing how devices find and identify each other across the vast network of the internet. It's like knowing the postal address system for digital information.

```
IP address is an unique numerical label used fot communication between devices connected to computers
primary functions : IP:internet protocol devices,Packets
```

### What role do routers play in the journey of data across the internet?

**Importance:** Routers are the traffic directors of the internet. Understanding their function explains how data packets navigate efficiently from source to destination through complex networks.

```
routers are traffic directors and determines the best path for data packets 
```

### What is the difference between a client and a server in the context of the internet?

**Importance:** This distinction is key to understanding most internet interactions, from browsing websites to sending emails, as it defines the roles devices play in requesting and providing information or services.

```
client is device ,which request resources over internent
server is a device, which provides resources to client over internet
```

# Task 2: What is HTTP?

### Describe the basic HTTP request/response cycle.

**Importance:** This cycle is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web. Understanding it is crucial for grasping how browsers fetch web pages and interact with web applications.

```
I) client request
II) request components : 1)methods(GET,POST,DELET,PUT) 2) URL 3)Body 4) header
III) server processing
IV) server response
V)  components : 1) body 2)header 3)status codes`

### What are the differences between the HTTP GET and POST methods?

**Importance:** GET and POST are two of the most common HTTP methods. Knowing their distinct purposes (retrieving vs. sending data) is essential for understanding how data is exchanged between a client (like a browser) and a server.

```
get : reterving data
post: sending data
```

### What does an HTTP status code like 404 Not Found or 200 OK signify?

**Importance:** Status codes provide critical feedback about the outcome of an HTTP request. Understanding common codes helps in diagnosing issues when browsing or developing web applications.

```
404: the requested resourse or content is not found on the server 
200 : request sucessfull
```

### Why is HTTPS preferred over HTTP?

**Importance:** Security is paramount online. Understanding the role of HTTPS highlights the importance of encrypting data exchanged over the web to protect user privacy and security.

```
HTTPS is preffered because it encrypts data and ensures integrity and authenticity 
```
